Here\'s a balanced assessment based on its key features:Design and Build QualityThe smartwatch boasts a sleek and modern design, with the Jet Black color adding a touch of sophistication. However, the build quality feels average, with a predominantly plastic construction that may not inspire confidence in terms of durability over the long term.Display and InterfaceFeaturing a 1.69" TFT display, the smartwatch offers a decent viewing experience for displaying notifications, fitness data, and other information. The interface is relatively intuitive, allowing for easy navigation through menus and functions, although it could benefit from some refinements for smoother operation.Features and FunctionalityThe standout features of the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch include advanced Bluetooth calling, SpO2 monitoring, and an extensive array of sports modes with auto-detection. While these features sound impressive on paper, their real-world performance may vary. Bluetooth calling functionality may be convenient, but the call quality and connectivity might not always meet expectations. SpO2 monitoring provides a basic indication of blood oxygen levels, although its accuracy may not rival dedicated medical devices. The auto-detection of sports modes is a handy feature for tracking workouts, but its reliability could be inconsistent.Battery LifeThe smartwatch promises up to 7 days of battery life under normal usage conditions, which is respectable for a device of this caliber. However, heavy calling can significantly reduce this battery life, with only around 2 days of endurance under such usage scenarios. While this may suffice for some users, others may find the need for frequent charging inconvenient.Value for MoneyIn terms of value for money, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch offers a decent package of features at a relatively affordable price point. It provides a range of functionalities typically found in higher-end smartwatches, making it an attractive option for those on a budget or looking for a more accessible entry into the smartwatch market.Overall ImpressionsOverall, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch presents a mixed bag of features and performance. While it offers a variety of functionalities at an affordable price, its average build quality, inconsistent performance of certain features, and limited battery life under heavy calling may leave some users wanting more. Nevertheless, for casual users looking for basic smartwatch capabilities with added health and fitness tracking, it could serve as a viable option.

Gliches I downloaded Mortal combat and opened the game suddenly the phone was not at all responding it kept on flickering between homescreen and lockscreen then I had to restart the phone and I am not sure whether this is a game issue or phone issue.3. OnePlus could have made the OS more user friendly when I longpress on any option it automatically turns it on and off I just wanted to get into options.4. AOD always on display is not optimised properly sometimes the in display fingerprint disappear and I had to unlock it using face unlock.5. Don't expect good quality camera definitely you will get noicy photos average quality photos only you can take.6. Temper glass I have tried many temper glass but I get bubbles on the edges this might the due rounded edges or curved. But trust me still I haven't found a good Temper glass for this nord CE3. Tried almost 5 different brands temper glass.Overall If you are thinking to buy this phone right now go for it because with all the discounts for 22k-23k for Nord CE3 it's worth buying because it has good display, fast charging 80W and better performance with SD 782g, but don't buy it for 25k it's not worth for that amount because of its Average quality Camera, Full Plastic Build quality, and not that great speakers average quality.

I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.Display:The 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.Storage:With 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos.

Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.Camera:The camera performance is good for the price range.

The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.Build Quality:The phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand.

Lower suction means lower battery consumption. With higher suction power even the minutest dust particles will be cleaned up (Good if you have children in the house). Higher suction also means you need to clean the dust chamber more frequently. In all the 4 power options, the house will look clean and will collect most visible dust. The higher options are for deep cleaning. Also if you have groves or areas that accumulate dust over time in the flooring, the higher power will pull out dust from these tiny places.Cleaning Pattern: 1st edges of the room are cleaned and then it will run a north-south or east-west cleaning pattern inside the edges.

For the 1st week, the mopping is not as good as the mopping pad does not entirely touch the floor but with usage the shape of pad will adapt and you will get better results.)Corner Cleaning: 1-2 cms of wall corners may not be cleaned, esp. if you don't have straight walls (E.g. if you have a bathroom door, which has a 1 cm cutout in the wall, then the corner area around the door might not be cleaned). 90 degree wall corners may have a 1-2 cm area which is not cleaned, however the side brushes are large enough for most of these corners. All other areas with obstacles, such as chair or table legs will be properly cleaned (Deebot may run around them 2 or 3 times).Corner Mopping: As the Deebot's mop is round, it will not reach the corners, expect a 5-6 cm area in the 90 degree wall corners not being mopped. However on straight walls, the cleaning is very effective as it may only miss 1-2 cms, which however will be cleaned by side brushes.IMPORTANT: If you have black furniture, Black stone / wall tiles, mirrors or any reflective furniture at the height where Deebot's Top mounted laser is located, the corner area near that black furniture will not be cleaned by Deebot. The laser is not able to properly recognize that it is a wall and will run a few centimeters away from that wall. This is important to consider if you have substantial amount of blacks in your house as the cleaning will be less effective.Mapping: The 1st run will map the entire house and you need to follow Deebot as it maps so that no areas are obstructed. Subsequent runs will update the map with any obstacles e.g chairs and tables if they were not initially mapped. The N8 version does not have additional sensors as the pro version. So it may crash into smaller items that the top mounted laser cannot directly see. Also, you can save at maximum of 2 maps at a time (2 floors). The 1st run will be a very random cleaning pattern. After the 1st run, you can edit the rooms (Divide or merge areas) and rename the rooms based on some preset options like Living room, bed room, kitchen, etc.). Once the rooms are mapped, Deebot will clean each room in the subsequent run and then you will be able to see proper cleaning pattern)The created maps are not editable (you cannot move or adjust boundaries). You have option to add virtual boundaries (as a line or as a rectangle box) where the robot should not go. This is extremely useful if you have mirrors or reflecting furniture at the height of Deebot. Deebot's laser reflects off the mirrors and assumes there is area of the house where it may be able to go (behind the mirror). So you need to manually block this mapped area behind the mirror with a virtual boundary or box. Deebot will automatically detect carpets and not mop over them (if you have installed mopping plate, then Deebot will ignore carpet area). Also there is an option to mark areas as no mop areas (Similar to Virtual boundary).Application Use: I used the android application for setup and regular cleaning functions. The app has an advanced mode, which works as per the stored map. If you turn it off, Deebot will start cleaning wherever you place it. E.g. I have a balcony which can't be accessed by the Deebot directly. I can pickup and place it in the balcony, turn advanced mode off and start cleaning. Once it is done, it will return to the place where you put it and notify that docking station is not accessible.The app also has 3 cleaning modes with advanced mode turned on. Area cleaning (Select a room or multiple rooms to clean), Auto clean (Clean the entire house), Custom Cleaning (Select an area on the map to clean).You can preset the sequence in which you want to clean the rooms. You can also set different vacuum and water levels for each room (or can use a common setting for the entire house). You can also preset how many times (Options are once or twice) you want to clean a specific room. You can also set multiple cleaning schedules based on which room you want to clean at what time of the day. Deebot will start working automatically. However, this is not advisable if you are mopping. As per the technician you must remove mopping plate after use. If any water leaks onto the parts, it may void warranty.There is an option to auto boost suction on carpets (to Max+). You can set the option for continuous cleaning, i.e. whether you want Deebot to auto restart cleaning if it runs out of charge midway. (Deebot will only recharge partially based on the remaining cleaning area, resume the cleaning, and then return to recharge - this saves time)The app also shows usage period of accessories in hours and the total expected usage time. It is an Ecovacs recommendation to replace the accessories - Side Brush, Main Brush, HEPA Filter. This area of the app also shows how to clean or maintain with images, which is really helpful.The app shows a history of cleaning cycles with maps. This helps to check if any areas were not cleaned.Cleaning and Maintenance: Expect that instead of cleaning the house daily, you will be washing the mopping pad every day and Cleaning Deebot once every week (depending on the size of your house). Cleaning will take around 30 to 40 minutes - remove all hairs from side brush, main brush and wheels, remove the dust chamber, remove the HEPA filter and wash the dust chamber, Wash the main and side brushes (if needed), Clean all the sensors of Deebot with a dry cloth, Let the washed accessories dry and then reinstall them. Also, remember that the investment in a robot is not a onetime cost. You will need to replace the accessories every 6-12 months based on the usage and maintenance. Consider the replacement cost also while evaluating a price point for investment in a robot vacuum.Overall Rating: 9/10 The cleaning and mopping performance is very good, and better than a house maid in most circumstances. (E.g. Deebot goes under the sofas). Expect manual work such as clearing the rooms before running the cleaning cycle, and cleaning areas out of reach of Deebot. In this price range, I am very satisfied with the performance.

The other feature that I really like about is the custom area where you can select a specified floor and ECOVAS does the work efficiently. I haven't tried the wet part so far and hopefully it should work as effectively as it was demonstrated. The only effort that you should put in is to clean the surface area of the unit after couple of cleans as the wheel's get the hair deposits tangled and to ensure free flow, one must regularly remove those tangled hair deposits.

Superb AmoLED display with that curve.... Wow it's too great.... It looks like you own a 50k+ mobile2. Camera quality is decent.. but have so much filters will blow and surprise you lol... I mean about photos... Video is on average .. yes you can shoot on 4k but the stability is too lowBut once again guys the photo is awesome with those filters I am totally satisfied3. Superfast GPU and RAM..4. Awesome in-hand experience.5. No blotwares I say nothing only stock apps like we needed Google apps as we use daily6. So much built in features like a samsung Max phones have.. especially the preventive touch option, in display scanner, lock app option, lock folder option, clone app function, ram enhance, those camera filters are awesome especially on front cam.. I say oppo filters will be 2nd if we compare both7. Taptics... Wow it's too awesome I say samsung and iPhone will have to get that hands on effects.. it's too good... I recomend to disable the sound effect while we clicking8. The intelligent part is it's using a stock Android OS so we can disable almost anything.CONS1. As this product is newly launched its case and screen guard is still not provided on Amazon. But It says it got the newer Gorilla glass protection and won't need screen guard... Hmmm I still need to figure it out2. As I said the phone case also is not available, we got a back clear cover with the phone but it's too low quality. I am sure it will turn yellow in 4 weeks ( a secret... I found a full glass case 3 in 1 on f l I p k a r t. I ordered it will update when I get that3. As I use currently a iPhone 8... It's too builky on my pockets and always keep opening screen and asking to use my fingure print to open. There is a option to disable accidental screen pressing but it still annoying and drain battery slowly ( so when I put the phone on pockets, I try to put the way that the front camera is on the front side .. open side4. It's fast charging is awesome but there is nothing to prevent the phone to put slow charging when it reach 80% and go normal. It rush to 100% and turn off charging ( I heard that after having 80% battery it's not good to fast charging... I am low with tech.. so leaving to those tech guys for a better review5. The back clear case which the company provided is not good. Just back case . Can't protect as the camera part is buldged6. Amazon didn't allow to get additional warranty as they give to other phones with price of 1500-2000, that's really bad7. No amazon sellers provide accidental or water protection damage replacement8. Also LAVA say they will replace the product at home for 1 year. But for only hardware issues... So I recomend to keep this phone as a babyFinally I love this awesome product which I got it lately after getting so many comparisons and much more waiting. They told to serve it in 2 days but need to be patient as I got it after 9 days...Update after 1 Month... We won't get any back case or flip case for the product.. the screen protector available is a substitute f om. Vivo v27+ but it's UV glass.. after scratch we need to remove carefully after 1 hour try slowly and peacefully else you will ruin the AmoLED displayI request the company to release more good cases and add the insurance to protect the devise as the other gadgets give us Read more", 'cust_rating': '5.0'}, {'cust_name': 'sohan singh', 'cust_review_desc': "The phone is excellent. Here are some :1. Display - It is as good as it can get. The screen is really big and crystal clear. Perfect for watching series or movies. Since it's amoled the wallpapers look really good too. Others say that the colours are too saturated but it doesn't seems like the case to me (they probably fixed it). 120hz feels too smooth too good.2. OS/Ui - I got this in October and since 2 updates have been released. One security patch and one for bug fixes. Overall the ui is stable and smooth. If you use a live wallpaper then your screen will constantly be on 120hz (when on auto) even if phone screen off. Slightly weird.3. Battery - Battery drains fast but charges really fast too. Although it might be a respective to user since I use live wallpaper 24/7, many customization apps that guarantee to affect battery/performance (like app TapTap, DynamicSpot, etc). Charging time is as advertised but can get really slow if you are actively using your phone.4. Camera - Not the best but pretty decent for the price. Still object/scenery in good lighting come out excellent. Not so good in low light but it's a problem all camera face. 4k Video is good as long as you are not moving. 60fps option only in hd quality, should have given in fhd too but disappointed. Portrait mode is weird. It makes you look 3D in an awfull way.Gaming - The processor is good enough to play most games in max quality. Why most? Because it can struggle to give even 30fps in some select games like genshin impact/star rail on ultra. But can give 60fps easily on medium quality. For bgmi players on smooth preset the fps is 90. Buttery smooth and a no lags whatsoever. Most other games run Super smooth on every quality level.Others - Fingerprint works well. No 3.5mm & NFC. Flash is pretty underwhelming. Not expandable storage but 256gb w cloud storage its enough for almost everyone. Doesn't feel too heavy. There is no inbuilt compass app! I had to install one from play store.Bugs - The bugs are less now but are still there. Eg there is a bug which actually prevents you from recording videos until you restart a phone. You might miss a crucial moment without you even realising. Idk what triggers it but it's random. Once every few weeks or so.Considering all this it's a pretty good curved phone for a price of 17.5k (sale). I believe it will be near perfect in this range once the bugs are removed in future updates.

The 1.4-inch touchscreen display is vibrant and easy to navigate, though it could be slightly larger for improved readability.Features:This smartwatch packs an impressive array of features considering its price point. It offers all-day activity tracking, including steps, distance, calories burned, and sleep monitoring. Additionally, it includes built-in sports modes for various activities like running, cycling, and more, providing users with valuable workout insights.The Fireboltt Phoenix also boasts basic smartwatch functionalities such as notifications for calls, messages, and social media alerts, allowing users to stay connected on the go. However, the device lacks advanced features like NFC for contactless payments or built-in GPS for precise tracking during outdoor activities.Performance:In terms of performance, the Fireboltt Phoenix delivers reliable results for basic fitness tracking. Step counts and sleep tracking are generally accurate, though users may experience occasional discrepancies. The battery life is respectable, offering around 5-7 days on a single charge with moderate usage.Compatibility:The Fireboltt Phoenix is compatible with both Android and iOS devices, ensuring broad accessibility for users across different platforms.

Nothing worked out. I visited the Authorized Service Center in Chennai (found address from Noise web page). The moment i told the issue, i was told to try replacement and there is no service option available; i learnt that brands such as Noise and fire-boltt are the brands that customers can take risk for the money spent; if it clicks fine, else, it goes to bin. I have booked for replacement and awaiting the delivery. Will post after my experience with replacement watch.My previous review just after one day usage:Delivery commitment: When I placed order it showed as next day delivery. However, it took five days to get the product. My interaction with Amazon Customer Support did not yield any benefit. So I waited patiently!Delivery experience: Seamless, on time as per the promised delivery date. OTP needs to be shared with the delivery person.Amazon Packaging: Comes in a Tamper-proof seal package, which is good;Product Packaging: Well packed to ensure safety of the Watch inside;Documentation: User Manual which is good enough for anyone to understand and follow through; product warranty card which guides through simple process steps for registering the product; Noise brand stickers which one might use, if liked; BookMyShow gift voucher which makes it mandatory to fill a google form and upload the image of review of the product; this sounds fishy; why should a gift come with subject to conditions; so if you are trying to claim the gift, you can‚Äôt skip that step of uploading the image/screenshot of your product review on the e-commerce sight from where you bought; in fact, I am eager to see whether it really works and hence writing this review, honestly!First look of the watch : looks decent with the metal outer rings and silicon strap; might look bulky if the wrist size is small; for my wrist size of 6‚Äù it just seem to be little bulky, which I am ok with; good thing is that it doesn‚Äôt appear to be bulging our of the wrist but stays almost flat on the wrist. The two knobs offer a classy look, of course. Silicon strap was looking premium, soft, and flexible enough. It is designed to tuck well inside your wrist so that you don‚Äôt have to frequently keep pushing it into the loop.Features: At this price band of (Rs.2,799 for me), it is definitely loaded with features. Has almost all essential things (health related, sport modes related, etc) covered.Initial setup: Initial setup of the devise was breezy. No hassles. Pairing with mobile (iOS) was seamless.User Interface: Navigating through the options/menus did not put any pressure. If you are used to a smartwatch, you don‚Äôt need the manual. New users might need to refer to the manual for few days and then become self-reliant in exploring.Calling: I would say it definitely raised the bar in terms of calling feature. You need to select the ‚ÄúNoise Buzz‚Äù feature to experience this feature. The call volume was adequate. For indoors it would be perfect. For outdoors, I got a feedback that the volume was low on the other end, though I did not face any issue (I set the volume at highest level). Adding contacts from mobile was seamless. I used dial-pad to dial few numbers and it was smooth. No problems there. Only thing I felt missing was, it lacked the feature of hanging the calls with a quick pre-loaded responses It could have made this feature a full rounded one.Mobile App: The app is quite interactive and easy to navigate. Only thing is that it takes approximately 8 seconds to load.Watch Face: Plenty of options including customizing options. However, on the watch, you can have only four watch faces. When you use photos from phone gallery, they look contoured around the corners, so I did not like it.Battery: When I got the delivery, the watch had 98% battery. I still charged to 100% (didn‚Äôt check how long it took to reach 100%). With 24 hours of non-stop usage after charging 100% battery power, with rise to wake enabled, call option enabled, notifications enabled, I see 1% drop in battery power. Hope it withstands for at least four days.Accuracy: I just checked the health related values which seem to be ok; but as usual, this is not something to depend on for any final diagnostic purpose. Though the option to auto-detect worked only after I walked nearly a kilometer and the counter started with 40 meters reading. However, after it started counting, I felt the results were closer to the other watch I had and the apple health app as well. Sleep tracking sounded weird to be. While I wore the watch for full night, it showed just 2hrs 17 minutes with 40 as score (not sure how to relate this). Need to try for one more night before being satisfied or being disappointed with this accuracy.Overall, I feel that I have taken a good call to buy this watch. Hope this lasts at least for a year or two.

It feels sticky and as you can see from the picture since I have a hairy hand, its pulling my hairs and takes a good 15 seconds to put on. I recommend buying a Nylon Soft loop band along with the watch.3. The APP is good and the pairing process with the watch was simple and seamless, but that's about it. The app is good for nothing after the initial pairing. It just does not work !!4. Downloading watch faces - It just does not work (Or at-least for me it does not). Initially it was taking a good 1 Minute for each watch face but after the first firmware update it has stopped working (See the third screenshot). The APP gets hung when I try to update a watch face.5. The SPO2 monitor appears in the menu when you press the physical button on the watch is not there when swipe the screen left where all the other options like Music, Sleep, Breathe, Stress, Heartrate and Activity are there. Noise forgot to add SPO2 there. Although not a problem but an additional step6. Its only IP67 so you cannot go underwater only splash proof7. Although company claims battery will last 9 days, but I Observed that the battery lasts on an average for about 7 Days and that too with no active features like continuous heart rate monitoring, Notification etc.8. The charging cable is sub-standard and I just hope that it lasts long, the wire is thin and I believe if the charging port was a square one like the one that comes with other watches, it would have been better.9. And yes the customer care doesn't care, If you try to reach them they send you a pre set message to try to resolve issue which is of no use.Hope prospective buyers read this review and stay away from this product for now and save their hard earned money, at-least till these issues are fixed for good by the company.

Coming to the Brightness, even in the Lowest Setting the display is clear enough on a cloudy day or overcast day... In an extremely Bright Sunny Day you might need to push the brightness to 2nd or 3rd Level and that'd be enough.

Here\'s a balanced assessment based on its key features:Design and Build QualityThe smartwatch boasts a sleek and modern design, with the Jet Black color adding a touch of sophistication. However, the build quality feels average, with a predominantly plastic construction that may not inspire confidence in terms of durability over the long term.Display and InterfaceFeaturing a 1.69" TFT display, the smartwatch offers a decent viewing experience for displaying notifications, fitness data, and other information. The interface is relatively intuitive, allowing for easy navigation through menus and functions, although it could benefit from some refinements for smoother operation.Features and FunctionalityThe standout features of the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch include advanced Bluetooth calling, SpO2 monitoring, and an extensive array of sports modes with auto-detection. While these features sound impressive on paper, their real-world performance may vary. Bluetooth calling functionality may be convenient, but the call quality and connectivity might not always meet expectations. SpO2 monitoring provides a basic indication of blood oxygen levels, although its accuracy may not rival dedicated medical devices. The auto-detection of sports modes is a handy feature for tracking workouts, but its reliability could be inconsistent.Battery LifeThe smartwatch promises up to 7 days of battery life under normal usage conditions, which is respectable for a device of this caliber. However, heavy calling can significantly reduce this battery life, with only around 2 days of endurance under such usage scenarios. While this may suffice for some users, others may find the need for frequent charging inconvenient.Value for MoneyIn terms of value for money, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch offers a decent package of features at a relatively affordable price point. It provides a range of functionalities typically found in higher-end smartwatches, making it an attractive option for those on a budget or looking for a more accessible entry into the smartwatch market.Overall ImpressionsOverall, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch presents a mixed bag of features and performance. While it offers a variety of functionalities at an affordable price, its average build quality, inconsistent performance of certain features, and limited battery life under heavy calling may leave some users wanting more. Nevertheless, for casual users looking for basic smartwatch capabilities with added health and fitness tracking, it could serve as a viable option.

Here\'s a balanced assessment based on its key features:Design and Build QualityThe smartwatch boasts a sleek and modern design, with the Jet Black color adding a touch of sophistication. However, the build quality feels average, with a predominantly plastic construction that may not inspire confidence in terms of durability over the long term.Display and InterfaceFeaturing a 1.69" TFT display, the smartwatch offers a decent viewing experience for displaying notifications, fitness data, and other information. The interface is relatively intuitive, allowing for easy navigation through menus and functions, although it could benefit from some refinements for smoother operation.Features and FunctionalityThe standout features of the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch include advanced Bluetooth calling, SpO2 monitoring, and an extensive array of sports modes with auto-detection. While these features sound impressive on paper, their real-world performance may vary. Bluetooth calling functionality may be convenient, but the call quality and connectivity might not always meet expectations. SpO2 monitoring provides a basic indication of blood oxygen levels, although its accuracy may not rival dedicated medical devices. The auto-detection of sports modes is a handy feature for tracking workouts, but its reliability could be inconsistent.Battery LifeThe smartwatch promises up to 7 days of battery life under normal usage conditions, which is respectable for a device of this caliber. However, heavy calling can significantly reduce this battery life, with only around 2 days of endurance under such usage scenarios. While this may suffice for some users, others may find the need for frequent charging inconvenient.Value for MoneyIn terms of value for money, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch offers a decent package of features at a relatively affordable price point. It provides a range of functionalities typically found in higher-end smartwatches, making it an attractive option for those on a budget or looking for a more accessible entry into the smartwatch market.Overall ImpressionsOverall, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch presents a mixed bag of features and performance. While it offers a variety of functionalities at an affordable price, its average build quality, inconsistent performance of certain features, and limited battery life under heavy calling may leave some users wanting more. Nevertheless, for casual users looking for basic smartwatch capabilities with added health and fitness tracking, it could serve as a viable option.

Here\'s a balanced assessment based on its key features:Design and Build QualityThe smartwatch boasts a sleek and modern design, with the Jet Black color adding a touch of sophistication. However, the build quality feels average, with a predominantly plastic construction that may not inspire confidence in terms of durability over the long term.Display and InterfaceFeaturing a 1.69" TFT display, the smartwatch offers a decent viewing experience for displaying notifications, fitness data, and other information. The interface is relatively intuitive, allowing for easy navigation through menus and functions, although it could benefit from some refinements for smoother operation.Features and FunctionalityThe standout features of the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch include advanced Bluetooth calling, SpO2 monitoring, and an extensive array of sports modes with auto-detection. While these features sound impressive on paper, their real-world performance may vary. Bluetooth calling functionality may be convenient, but the call quality and connectivity might not always meet expectations. SpO2 monitoring provides a basic indication of blood oxygen levels, although its accuracy may not rival dedicated medical devices. The auto-detection of sports modes is a handy feature for tracking workouts, but its reliability could be inconsistent.Battery LifeThe smartwatch promises up to 7 days of battery life under normal usage conditions, which is respectable for a device of this caliber. However, heavy calling can significantly reduce this battery life, with only around 2 days of endurance under such usage scenarios. While this may suffice for some users, others may find the need for frequent charging inconvenient.Value for MoneyIn terms of value for money, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch offers a decent package of features at a relatively affordable price point. It provides a range of functionalities typically found in higher-end smartwatches, making it an attractive option for those on a budget or looking for a more accessible entry into the smartwatch market.Overall ImpressionsOverall, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch presents a mixed bag of features and performance. While it offers a variety of functionalities at an affordable price, its average build quality, inconsistent performance of certain features, and limited battery life under heavy calling may leave some users wanting more. Nevertheless, for casual users looking for basic smartwatch capabilities with added health and fitness tracking, it could serve as a viable option.

The accuracy needs to checked more from my end, adjusting the step length in Da-Fit changes the steps and miles tracked. I need to fine-tune it.Feels a little heavy on the wrist, perhaps my personal feeling. The amoled display is really cool with crisp fonts and pleasant watch faces makes it an elegant choice.

Amoled display, it is a very good feature to be included at this price range.3. Bluetooth calling sound is above average I would say , it will be hard to use in a loud crowded place though.4. Premium metal finish.5. Very good battery back up I have been using it without charging for the past 8 days and right now the battery is at 31% so average 10% per day consumption (company claims 7 days which is accurate) but it will vary to the extent of your usage. I used it at low(1) brightness indoors with minimalist watch face and 3 level brightness outdoors with Bluetooth calling enabled and wrist awake feature on and heart monitoring every 5 minutes feature is also on. Always on and tap to start feature is off.6. Health monitoring is also quite accurate.7. Always on, palm feature , tap to on, wrist awake are all present which is great actually.8. Decent Android app(Noisefit) for customisation and monitoring.Cons.1. UI is slow doesn't look like 60hz but 20hz.scrolling is laggy. Hope it improves with update.2. Touch to start is also laggy.3. Wrist awake is also not the smoothest but works 90% of the time but laggy.4. Music can't be played although it has a widget for music.(for pause/play and next only).5. Laggy implementation or synchronisation of command such as don't disturb and silent.AnywayOverall verdict is that for this price range it is indeed value for money.Expectations lead to disappointments so if you expect features of high end accuracy of high end smart watches you will be disappointed. It is just an upgraded fitness watch with amoled display and Bluetooth calling feature.Hope this helps.Update : Bluetooth reconnection fail and repairing is next to impossible. Only way is reset.

Here\'s a balanced assessment based on its key features:Design and Build QualityThe smartwatch boasts a sleek and modern design, with the Jet Black color adding a touch of sophistication. However, the build quality feels average, with a predominantly plastic construction that may not inspire confidence in terms of durability over the long term.Display and InterfaceFeaturing a 1.69" TFT display, the smartwatch offers a decent viewing experience for displaying notifications, fitness data, and other information. The interface is relatively intuitive, allowing for easy navigation through menus and functions, although it could benefit from some refinements for smoother operation.Features and FunctionalityThe standout features of the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch include advanced Bluetooth calling, SpO2 monitoring, and an extensive array of sports modes with auto-detection. While these features sound impressive on paper, their real-world performance may vary. Bluetooth calling functionality may be convenient, but the call quality and connectivity might not always meet expectations. SpO2 monitoring provides a basic indication of blood oxygen levels, although its accuracy may not rival dedicated medical devices. The auto-detection of sports modes is a handy feature for tracking workouts, but its reliability could be inconsistent.Battery LifeThe smartwatch promises up to 7 days of battery life under normal usage conditions, which is respectable for a device of this caliber. However, heavy calling can significantly reduce this battery life, with only around 2 days of endurance under such usage scenarios. While this may suffice for some users, others may find the need for frequent charging inconvenient.Value for MoneyIn terms of value for money, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch offers a decent package of features at a relatively affordable price point. It provides a range of functionalities typically found in higher-end smartwatches, making it an attractive option for those on a budget or looking for a more accessible entry into the smartwatch market.Overall ImpressionsOverall, the Noise Pulse Go Buzz Smart Watch presents a mixed bag of features and performance. While it offers a variety of functionalities at an affordable price, its average build quality, inconsistent performance of certain features, and limited battery life under heavy calling may leave some users wanting more. Nevertheless, for casual users looking for basic smartwatch capabilities with added health and fitness tracking, it could serve as a viable option.

This suitcase not only caught my eye with its stylish cyan color but also impressed me with its overall performance.The hard polycarbonate casing of the luggage gives me confidence that my belongings are well-protected during my travels. While it's not entirely wear-resistant, it has managed to hold up well without any major scratches or dents, even after some rough handling.One of the standout features of this suitcase is its spacious interior. With a capacity of 57.6 liters, it offers ample room for all my clothes and essentials, making it perfect for longer trips. What surprised me is that despite its size, the suitcase is relatively lightweight, making it easy to maneuver and carry when necessary.The 4-wheel 360-degree rotation system is a game-changer when it comes to mobility. It glides effortlessly in any direction, and I appreciate how it makes navigating crowded airports and tight spaces a breeze. This feature has saved me a lot of effort and time during my travels.The number lock is another convenient feature, providing an extra layer of security for my belongings, giving me peace of mind when I have to check it in.It's also worth noting that this luggage is proudly made in India, which is a pleasant surprise for those who support local products.However, one thing to keep in mind is that the suitcase is not entirely waterproof. While it can handle some light exposure to moisture, it's not suitable for heavy rain. So, if you're traveling in wet conditions, make sure to use a rain cover or pack your sensitive items in waterproof bags.In conclusion, the Safari Ray 67 cms Medium Check-in Polycarbonate Luggage is a stylish, durable, and spacious suitcase that offers excellent mobility. Its minor drawback is the lack of complete waterproofing, but it excels in other aspects, making it a great addition to any traveler's essentials. Plus, the fact that it's made in India is an added bonus for those looking to support local products.

Let's take a closer look and see if it delivers on its promises.Highlights:Performance Punch: The 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB DDR4 RAM provides enough muscle for daily tasks like document editing, web browsing, and even light creative work.Storage Symphony: With 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, boot times are lightning-fast and accessing files feels like a breeze.Display Delight: The 15.6-inch Full HD display is bright and crisp, making everyday tasks enjoyable and movies immersive.Backlit Bonanza: The backlit keyboard allows for comfortable typing in low-light environments, a boon for late-night warriors.Windows & Office Combo: Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 21 Home & Student come pre-installed, saving you time and money.Room for Improvement:Thermal Throttling: Under heavy load, the laptop can get hot and throttle its performance slightly. This might be noticeable for demanding tasks like video editing or heavy gaming.Average Battery Life: Expect around 6-7 hours of battery life with moderate usage. Power users might need to stay close to an outlet.Ports Galore (or Not): While the laptop offers a good range of ports, some users might miss an SD card reader or an HDMI port in favor of USB-C options.Fingerprint Reader Fickleness: The fingerprint reader can be a bit slow and finicky at times, requiring multiple attempts to unlock.Overall:The Dell 15 is a competent workhorse for students, professionals, and casual users. It delivers solid performance, a pleasant display, and comes equipped with Windows and Office right out of the box. However, thermal throttling, average battery life, and some quirks with the fingerprint reader might hold it back for power users or those on the move frequently.Verdict:If you're looking for a reliable and affordable everyday laptop for work, study, or basic entertainment, the Dell 15 is a compelling option. Just be aware of its limitations, especially if you have demanding needs or prioritize portability.Remember: This review is based on the specific configuration mentioned. Other configurations of the Dell 15 might have different specs and performance.I hope this helps you decide if the Dell 15 is the right laptop for you!

I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though.

But as soon as i received it I was very much impressed with built quality and design. It is sleek, weightless and punches above its wieght in terms of performance. The battery life is pretty good for normal day to day use, and you will surely get about 4:30 to 5 hours screen time. The performance was great, having a power packed specs, good for 98% of the heavyload tasks. It was all good for 1 to 2 days and then disaster struck. Let me explain this ordeal in detail.The problem I faced was in regards to the display, it suddenly started to flicker when it is not charging. I was heart broken. I tried all methods to fix it, from driver updates to changing display setting but all failed. I contacted Asus customer care and was told an engineer will contact me to help out. I sent the video when this happens to the engineer and he said it is a manufacturing defect. He then told me that i will get a display replacement after 2 days but the following day he told me that since its a new laptop and I reported the issue within 7days of purchase, I am eligible for the laptop replacement. I was then asked to come to service center for it to be packaged properly with the doa certificate attached (This certificate will be provided by asus engineer) to it. I called amazon customer care for return and they told me that only refund will be provided and not replacement and I was asked to attached some documents required for verification. Atlast I was able to return this laptop after some big troubles while returning (Happened to me due to me not being available on the return day). The funny thing is even after facing so many issues when i by purchasing this latptop, I decided to order this same laptop again from amazon believeing that not all laptop will have manufacturing defects. After few days I got the new laptop, and again it was working fine for 1 day and then it started again. This time I was completely broke, having no idea on what to do next. But this time I decided not to return the laptop but instead find a solution be it display replacement or any other software based solution. This flickering issue is not a rare issue but many oled laptops face these due to the underlying technology these oled displays are built upon. After intense research and fidgiting with the settings, I found the culprit. This whole flickering issue is due to a power saving setting known as self panel refresh. This is enabled by default which cause the display panel to refresh in its own frequency rather that the hz specified. This setting is by intel and can be found in the Intel graphics command center under the system tab. After turning this off, this whole issue stopped and from that I have not had any issue with this laptop. Its definitely a great product which I am sure you will not regret unless you face the same issue that I faced ü§£ü§£. A special metion to the display ratio of 16:10, which makes this laptop look like a 15 inch laptop.

Let's take a closer look and see if it delivers on its promises.Highlights:Performance Punch: The 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB DDR4 RAM provides enough muscle for daily tasks like document editing, web browsing, and even light creative work.Storage Symphony: With 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, boot times are lightning-fast and accessing files feels like a breeze.Display Delight: The 15.6-inch Full HD display is bright and crisp, making everyday tasks enjoyable and movies immersive.Backlit Bonanza: The backlit keyboard allows for comfortable typing in low-light environments, a boon for late-night warriors.Windows & Office Combo: Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 21 Home & Student come pre-installed, saving you time and money.Room for Improvement:Thermal Throttling: Under heavy load, the laptop can get hot and throttle its performance slightly. This might be noticeable for demanding tasks like video editing or heavy gaming.Average Battery Life: Expect around 6-7 hours of battery life with moderate usage. Power users might need to stay close to an outlet.Ports Galore (or Not): While the laptop offers a good range of ports, some users might miss an SD card reader or an HDMI port in favor of USB-C options.Fingerprint Reader Fickleness: The fingerprint reader can be a bit slow and finicky at times, requiring multiple attempts to unlock.Overall:The Dell 15 is a competent workhorse for students, professionals, and casual users. It delivers solid performance, a pleasant display, and comes equipped with Windows and Office right out of the box. However, thermal throttling, average battery life, and some quirks with the fingerprint reader might hold it back for power users or those on the move frequently.Verdict:If you're looking for a reliable and affordable everyday laptop for work, study, or basic entertainment, the Dell 15 is a compelling option. Just be aware of its limitations, especially if you have demanding needs or prioritize portability.Remember: This review is based on the specific configuration mentioned.

I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though.

I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usage Read more", 'cust_rating': '4.0'}, {'cust_name': 'Ravi Shab', 'cust_review_desc': "The speed mentioned is 4.4 GHz whereas the actual speed is 1.3 GHz.

H-series is running like a racing horse, when u give it heavy task, processor boost its frequency and initiate hyper threading.4.BATTERY :backup depends upon how you use, with hardcore gaming it gives 4+ hour of backup, normal tasking with 50% brightness gives you 7+ hour of backup.5. FEATURES :#Wuxga screen gives u richness in colour but lack behind of Oled (but manageable due to very less price),still better than lcd & lft & tft.#Camera privacy have both option shut off by key with LED indicator and shutoff by physical shutter.#Mic privacy shutter is given by key with led indicator. It is a good decision taken by asus for nowdays need,.#180¬∞ hinge is additional things but u will not use it often unless u have to share something on the table. Still good thing for future proof & it also save u from hinge damage by excess elongation,#Fingerprint sensor is very fast, ultra responsive and read ur fingerprint very accurately. Something about 0.2 second it takes#Camera is average not good not bad but decent#TouchPad is big enough and multitouch sensor with best interactive pad.#Charging is fast as needed(roughly it takes 1 hour)Key Backlit gives u 3 mode brightness have blue-whitish glow.#Cooling system is efficient, it ON when heavy task is executed, bluetooth wifi is awesome with latest technology as today it provide.#Light in weight 1.8 kg, slim design.@Overall everything is good.Considering Price & value it is 100% recommended.Thankyou amazon for fast delivery (within 2 day) , and asus for a wonderful product.

It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell.Dislike :It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot.Some points to clear confusion:1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future.* There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted.2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB.3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet.4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm.5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too.6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise.7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off.*The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones.If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop.I hope this helps.

I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work.

Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usage Read more", 'cust_rating': '4.0'}, {'cust_name': 'Ravi Shab', 'cust_review_desc': "The speed mentioned is 4.4 GHz whereas the actual speed is 1.3 GHz.

Let's take a closer look and see if it delivers on its promises.Highlights:Performance Punch: The 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB DDR4 RAM provides enough muscle for daily tasks like document editing, web browsing, and even light creative work.Storage Symphony: With 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, boot times are lightning-fast and accessing files feels like a breeze.Display Delight: The 15.6-inch Full HD display is bright and crisp, making everyday tasks enjoyable and movies immersive.Backlit Bonanza: The backlit keyboard allows for comfortable typing in low-light environments, a boon for late-night warriors.Windows & Office Combo: Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 21 Home & Student come pre-installed, saving you time and money.Room for Improvement:Thermal Throttling: Under heavy load, the laptop can get hot and throttle its performance slightly. This might be noticeable for demanding tasks like video editing or heavy gaming.Average Battery Life: Expect around 6-7 hours of battery life with moderate usage. Power users might need to stay close to an outlet.Ports Galore (or Not): While the laptop offers a good range of ports, some users might miss an SD card reader or an HDMI port in favor of USB-C options.Fingerprint Reader Fickleness: The fingerprint reader can be a bit slow and finicky at times, requiring multiple attempts to unlock.Overall:The Dell 15 is a competent workhorse for students, professionals, and casual users. It delivers solid performance, a pleasant display, and comes equipped with Windows and Office right out of the box. However, thermal throttling, average battery life, and some quirks with the fingerprint reader might hold it back for power users or those on the move frequently.Verdict:If you're looking for a reliable and affordable everyday laptop for work, study, or basic entertainment, the Dell 15 is a compelling option. Just be aware of its limitations, especially if you have demanding needs or prioritize portability.Remember: This review is based on the specific configuration mentioned.

The keyboard is good with three stages of backlit brightness.The pros: excellent display brightness and clarity, the resolution of this display on a 14 inch screen makes it crisp and clear. Since its an amoled display and pantone validated the colour accuracy out of the box is awsome.Display is glossy but at med to max brightness indoors the glare and reflections are under control nothing to worry about there.The speakers are excellent don't fall for the bad speaker reviews, the speakers are low sounding out of the box, as the guy in other review mentioned just turn on the dynamic mode in Dolby app and turn on volume boost in my asus app, they get loud and the sourround sound is excellent for the movies and any other content you might watch. Don't except a huge amount of bass though, the bass is just there you can notice it, but the surround sound with mids and lows will cover up for that anyways. The speakers are downfiring and doesnt feel that way with atmos enabled. The sound can easily fill up midsized room when the laptop is sitting on desk while in lap the sound is enough for one person to enjoy even with a relatively loud surrounding area.The professor and Ram are fine and fast, using intensive tasks such as photo editing and casual gaming can best done with ac power connected, while on battery its best to be used an ultrabook for office tasks and using it to study if you're a student to take classes in power saver mode will give you six to eight hours of battery life.I dont see any cons since I dont care about it heating a bit while sitting on a table, when I use it on lap I just use it for content consumption rather than for heavy tasks, after all this a slim laptop so heating over a period of lengthy tasks is to be expected with an Intel processor In it, the lucky part is that atleast it had two fans to cool unlike the new zenbook laptops.I dont use the webacam anyways so, I dont care about it personally but its there, its 720p for those who want to know. Read more", 'cust_rating': '5.0'}, {'cust_name': 'Placeholder', 'cust_review_desc': 'Ok so ill get into it quick, ordered the laptop for rupees seven 1 triple nine and also hdfc discount of five k .now coming to the laptopPros (in order of priorities) :1. Screen ( 10/10)Brilliant display . its just amazing 2.8k with oled .one of the main reasons i bought it. see heres the thing. the only part in your pc that you will be using to 100% , not the CPU not the ram not the ssd. its the display. you will always be viewing it all the time. Andi was very particular on having a good display as i would be staring at it for 6-8hrs everyday.Oleds are amazing, you cant go back once you start using it.its amazing for me as i can go dark mode for majority of applications and it significantly reduces the strain on my eyesVsCode is just lovely on dark mode, it goes fully black with this screen so no strain whatsoever.Also the 16:10 aspect ratio really helps, more vertical screen space. while still portable like a regular 14incher2. Build (10/10)its a neat metalic build , with good craftmenship and design. Looks very premium .built sturdy as well.this was important to me as i will be travelling often now and want something that i know i can trust.btw if your considering between Zenbook and Vivobook with same specs, i would highly suggest a zenbook even if with a slightly higher price differnce. Have used vivobook k513 oled for 1.5 yrs. while everything was good. the build quality always scared me.knew it would break if not taken care properly. Also the screen got some internal uncleanable stains after 3months.Whatever money your trying to save youll make it back when reselling the laptop anyways.3. Performance ( i5-12500H , 16gb LPDDR5X , 512gb pcie 4 ssd, )The Processor:An absolute beast, can handle anything. Has a geekbench score of 10544. it even beats the 11th generation i9also friendly tip: Whenever looking for a laptop, dont just go on the i3 vs i5 vs i7 vs i9 . and think if the number after " i " is bigger it would be a better processor.This is not true and big misconception in general public .the more important thing to see is the generation. this pc is a good example . it has i5 12th gen but i5 12t h gen is more powerful than even i9 of 11th gen.yes if the generation is same then defenitily you can follow the i3 > i5> i7> i9. But even then value for money caps out at i5. You would not be getting significantly more powerful pc after i5 . just slight incrementsGPU:it has an integrated graphics card. Can be used for light casual gaming .Its more than good enough for something time to time.Obviously if your looking for something just for gaming , want to play latest AAA titles you already know this is not for you.RAM and SSD:Top notch, but feel that a 32gb option or an upgradable slot should have been given.As more number of cores = more ram consumedOther positives:- The speakers are loud enough and good clarity, has dolby atmos.- So the charger is type C and adaptive with 15W 27W 45W and 100W . Quick charging for laptop and also very helpful while travelling as you will not need to carry 2 chargers always and can charge your phone , earphones too- the fingerprint scanner is embedded in the power button, gives a very smooth experience when turning on. just click the button and it turns on. no need of again giving the finger print once in lock screen- so generally you will not get numpad with 14inch laptops, but this has a touch numpad, personally not so useful for me . but good attempt by the company never the less.Negatives:Honestly for the price i bought it , its very good. no issues. im not one of those people that are never satisfied no matter what, comparing with laptop with 2x 3x of the the price or making wrong claims or having unreasonable expectationssaw a review here complaining why there was no dedicated gpu and he was dissatisfied because of it...ok broalso another guy saying that the touch numpad is not good and he was expecting a on keyboard one and hence was disappointed( bro in 14inch ultrabooks nobody gives a onkeyboard numpad because of size, the touch numpad they gave was just a bonus. well and good if useful but i dont see whats the point of complaining )- another guy saying that he was disappointed because in oled you always need to use darkmode. This is not true btw. and bro you should have researched a bit before buying right.but if i had to point something out , again very minor or solvable issues1. so the fan is on the right side , so if you have a habit of using a mouse, the hot air will blow directly to your hand .2. only 1 USB Type A slot. so you will not be able simultaneously plug in a mouse and keyboard or a pendrive lets say.but again im just being too picky over here. easily solvable with using a converter on the type c ports. and anyhow i think now the world is moving towards type c ports itself. and should be standard with everything moving forwardConclusion:Again if you can get it for the price i mentioned on top, and the points in my review make sense to you , you can go for it.############EDIT: 4 Month updateNo issues so far, laptop working the same..one more pointscreen is a glossy so problamtic in sunny areas . but i think all oleds do come with glossy itself for some reason Read more', 'cust_rating': '5.0'}, {'cust_name': 'Amazon Customer', 'cust_review_desc': 'The product is superb. But know that the amd version of these are available in flipkart, and that may be better than this in battery life.This laptop is extremely powerfull, but since it is a compact laptop, there is heating issues.Battery life is now around 3 hours. Initially it was around 1 hr. Battery life stabilizes only after a week or so.There is coil whine sound from my laptop, but when i visited asus service, they told that it will not harm the device.The display is great. Look of product is great.But if you need battery and you are not going to do intense tasks, you better go for other processors of zenbook.note: If you are opting for an exchange, know that the exchange amount will not be credited to your bank account if you return this item. It will be credited as Amazon pay balance, which is of not much use.I opted for a replacement since there was coil whine sound, but amazon told me that there will be no replacement but only return. Since my exchange amount will only be credited in amazon pay, I settled with the given product after consulting asus service centre.I think going with flipkart will be a much better idea, since their models are somewhat superior.After purchasing any asus laptop, go to asuspromo.in site and there is huge discount in purchasing extended warranty. In my research, the extended warranty option of amazon and flipkart are not dependable.Apart from all these, the laptop is snappy and the display is just amazing.edit: Recently i came to know about temporarily disabling extra cores of this cpu when not in use. If you are doing only browsing and movie watching then by disabling extra cores, you can get around 5+ hrs of battery life. you can disable the cores in device manager. Watch any youtube video before doing this.

The screen is amazing but requires maintenance and mindfulness to prevent OLED burn-in. Very good with casual gaming and working balance, battery lasts around 7 hours while using browsing the internet and using MS-Office.Some random things that came up which might not be obvious at first after using it for a couple of weeks:Pros-1. Great battery life when used for work stuff. This can be improved by disabling the GPU which I haven't tried yet but already get about 4-5 hours from 80% to 20% charging cycles.2. Colours on the screen are truly beautiful, you'd want to re-play games or re-watch movies just to appreciate how stunning they're capable of being.3. The MyAsus app is very helpful in customizing specific settings to improve the health of the laptop or to customize settings for specific purposes (gaming, productivity, media consumption).4. Very fast to boot up and sign in with the 1TB SSD. The fingerprint power button scans your finger when you turn it on so it goes straight to the desktop instead of the sign-in screen.5. The 16GB RAM make it very easy to play pre-2021 games at good graphics and to have multiple games downloaded in the huge SSD. The laptop doesn't get loud and doesn't heat up too much to be noticeable. Hitman 3, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, GTA V, Fortnite all worked flawlessly and looked great.6. Lightweight so it's very comfortable and convenient to carry on the go.7. Perfect for photo/video editing based on the hardware capabilities and the amazing range of colours on the screen.8. Very cool and quiet in regular usage.9. Web camera quality is very sharp.Cons-1. Using the camera drains the battery surprisingly quickly. Being on Zoom and Google Meets with the webcam on has a very quick battery drain.2. There might be some driver issues, my mouse stopped working for a whole day and I could not figure out a solution. Use the MyAsus app to update drivers and BIOS as it fixes driver issues easily where Windows Driver Updates don't work.3. The angle of the laptop screen hinges is very limited, something I did not pay attention to when buying. It only does about 120 degrees or so which might be a hindrance depending on the angle at which you place the laptop on your desk.4. The graphics card is somewhat lacking but then again it is not supposed to be an all out gaming laptop. Games like FIFA23 work smoothly but not on high graphics settings which is to be expected.5. If you want to make the screen last for 3+ years it is important to implement a lot of settings like taskbar auto-hide, task window dimming, cycling wallpapers, short screen timeout, dark modes everywhere etc. because bright elements at a fixed spot can cause OLED burn-in.6. The screen despite being great is only Full HD 1080p at 60hz refresh rate. Was hoping for 120hz at this price but that's the trade-off with getting an OLED screen.7. There are no media function buttons on the keyboard to play/pause/forward/rewind music which I've been used to on most laptops so had to implement trackpad gestures to be able to do this.The cons are me being nit-picky, otherwise this so far seems to be a perfect laptop if you're getting it primarily for work and hoping to just casually game as a pastime.

Let's take a closer look and see if it delivers on its promises.Highlights:Performance Punch: The 11th Gen Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB DDR4 RAM provides enough muscle for daily tasks like document editing, web browsing, and even light creative work.Storage Symphony: With 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, boot times are lightning-fast and accessing files feels like a breeze.Display Delight: The 15.6-inch Full HD display is bright and crisp, making everyday tasks enjoyable and movies immersive.Backlit Bonanza: The backlit keyboard allows for comfortable typing in low-light environments, a boon for late-night warriors.Windows & Office Combo: Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 21 Home & Student come pre-installed, saving you time and money.Room for Improvement:Thermal Throttling: Under heavy load, the laptop can get hot and throttle its performance slightly. This might be noticeable for demanding tasks like video editing or heavy gaming.Average Battery Life: Expect around 6-7 hours of battery life with moderate usage. Power users might need to stay close to an outlet.Ports Galore (or Not): While the laptop offers a good range of ports, some users might miss an SD card reader or an HDMI port in favor of USB-C options.Fingerprint Reader Fickleness: The fingerprint reader can be a bit slow and finicky at times, requiring multiple attempts to unlock.Overall:The Dell 15 is a competent workhorse for students, professionals, and casual users. It delivers solid performance, a pleasant display, and comes equipped with Windows and Office right out of the box. However, thermal throttling, average battery life, and some quirks with the fingerprint reader might hold it back for power users or those on the move frequently.Verdict:If you're looking for a reliable and affordable everyday laptop for work, study, or basic entertainment, the Dell 15 is a compelling option. Just be aware of its limitations, especially if you have demanding needs or prioritize portability.Remember: This review is based on the specific configuration mentioned. Other configurations of the Dell 15 might have different specs and performance.I hope this helps you decide if the Dell 15 is the right laptop for you!

The RTX 3050 with 95TGP is really capable and doesn't break a sweat while playing on high graphics. I played God of War on Original settings and it was able to consistently deliver 60fps. The dlss works as magic and really improves your experience.2. The thermals are great. While testing I pushed it to its limits and the CPU temp didn't go beyond 95¬∞C. Not because of thermal throttling but at some limit it stays constant. I like to play it casually at about 80% usage of GPU and it gives me amazing experience with temp. not going beyond 84¬∞C.3. The display is love.üòò Really nice display. You can watch movies play games and you will get immersive experience. You can get same specs laptop with RTX3050 in price less than its in its competitor laptop but the display on this one is really great and you will love it.4. I bought the ryzen 5 16gb variant. The processor is capable too and the dual channel DDR5 RAM really helps.5. If you like RGB you are going to love its keyboard. The keys are tactile and the four zone RGB lights is awesome (especially in nightüòÅ).6. This is the latest version and it comes with latest specs - latest 7gen ryzen processors, DDR5 RAM, wifi 6E and blutooth 5.2. In connectivity you get future proof with latest wifi and Bluetooth version.CONS:1. The battery is not that nice. It only lasts 1.5-2 hrs. I know gaming laptop are not known for good battery but I expected 2.5-3 hrs which usually other gaming laptop provide.2. I felt the speakers are too much low. If you're watching movie alone then too you might not get good experience. For me its not a deal breaker as when single I use earphone and when watching movie with someone I prefer speaker.3. The camera is 720p and its not that amazing. I know that in gaming laptop you get this type of camera only. But those who are buying laptop for meetings or videos call don't buy gaming laptop. Yoi can get other thin and light EVO certified 1080p webcam laptop in price less than this.Just a PRO TIP here:. Whether you buy Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 just don't go for 8gb variant as According to ACER upgrading RAM voids warranty and 8gb is less for gaming or heavy software or multi tasking. So go for 16GB ram variant. Plus its dual channel so you would get better experience with it.

The build quality of this laptop is excellent.Although the laptop is heavy, I don't find it problematic.An excellent perk is 8 GB of DDR5 RAM. A Samsung 512GB SSD M.2 2242 42mm PM9B1 NVMe PCIe 4.0 Gen4 was utilised by Dell. Thus, this laptop boots up quite quickly.It was simple to register the warranty, but keep in mind that Dell will only offer you a one-year basic guarantee.A 180W charger charges quickly. You can only use the battery saver option for up to 2.5 hours.Battery capacity is 56 Wh.The display on this laptop is very good. Pre-activated MSO 21 and Windows 11 is also a huge benefit.After comparing numerous laptops from Dell, HP, Asus, and Acer, I ultimately decided on Dell and think it was a wise decision.It is a supersilent device that doesn't become hot during normal use. The keyboard and mouse pad respond quickly and smoothly.The laptop's camera quality is the finest in the gaming market.Go for this laptop on faith.

I'll highlight pointwise.Speed - The processor is 12 Gen i5 12500H with 45W and 12 cores. I code continuously and work on multiple tabs with high data and memory usage and the laptop handles everything smoothly. The screen refresh rate is a plus in this scenario as well in addition to gaming.Appearance - It has got looks to kill, everyone asks me which is this laptop. Looks superb.Build Quality - It is built to last and can take minor bumps easily.Display - The display quality is debatable for many but personally I like it a lot because it's easy on eyes and I can work whole day on it even in low light with very little to no eye strain. Oled and high res display are better but not for all day coders or gamers like me.Thermals - Many are saying it heats a lot. Yes it heats a lot only when you are gaming for high performance. If you don't turn on G button then it is like any other laptop and stays cool with better battery life as well.Sound - The laptop has sound quality like none other. You have to hear it to believe it. Trust ke you will feel like you are listening to tv or bluetooth speaker. It is that loud and smooth.Weight - The only downside is the weight. I recommend a good bag to carry the laptop as it is heavy. You will get used to it but it is heavy like other gaming laptops.Gameplay - Till now I played Forza 4&5,Battlefield, Fifa, GTA V and all ran smoothly with medium to high setting. Gaming is good but go for 16gb version if you solely want to play games. Else 8gb is enough for heavy work loads and casual gaming. Nvidia RTX3050 is so good, you'll know when you use it.Keyboard and Touchpad - The keys look great with orange back light and are very easy to click so is the touchpad super smooth.Outlets - It has got points for usb type all types, rj45, audio jack, hdmi so no issues.Camera - It is best in class and has good clarity.Finally Dell support and warranty is class leading, I got good warranty cover and support whenever needed with just a mail within their app provided in laptop.I wanted to go for dell latitude but G15 is better bang for buck so I opted for it.

It's really hard to get one with this quality screen and size for this price range and I'm guessing this is the only true gaming laptop in offering..So to sum it up awesome laptop, great build quality,great thermals, aesthetically pleasing, but sub-par specs for price.

And I got much better performance like 150-160+ fps in Apex , cs 2 and 100+ fps in GTA ...so it\'s very good GPUThe speakers have clear vocals and clarity.. although the basis and overall sound might be little low compared to other laptop but the quality and richness of sound by Dolby Atmos covers up the basis qualityPorts and connectivity are good ..I don\'t need any extra accessory to buyAnd Intel i5 13450hx CPU is monster..just one word is enough "monster"Most imp thing that this laptop lags is the battery department..With very low usage (full power saving mode) I got almost 2hr backup...with standard usage (CPU GPU is active but performing only casual gaming for 10-15 min and other officials task performed) I got 1hr 20 min backup..and when full GPU performance mode is on for high intensive gaming..I got 40 min backup just!! So plug in charger and then do gaming is highly recommended!!Important tip for all!! Get a 6-16Amp universal socket converter as charger\'s pin won\'t support in normal household socketOverall I use this laptop most of the time in power saving settings and I am really happy with its performance..if you are looking for this premium laptop than go for it, it\'s value for money for students, gamers as well as creators too!!Peace out.

I even reached out to a few official stores, but they were unsure about its authenticity.However, after comparing the specs and price of this laptop, I found it to be a fantastic value at 90k. The next day, I received the laptop, and I was pleased to see that all the specs matched, and the product was indeed genuine. The performance is exceptional, and the product arrived in great condition with excellent packaging.One thing to note is that this laptop comes with a 240W charger brick with a 20A plug, which wasn't mentioned anywhere. Unfortunately, I didn't have a 20A socket at the moment, so I had to purchase a separate adapter.I found the brightness to be average, even though it's advertised as 300 nits. However, overall, I'm quite satisfied with the laptop and its performance. It is a bit heavier compared to my previous OMEN series laptop, but that's a minor trade-off for the value it offers.I've been using it for only a week, so I'll continue to monitor its performance and will update my review with any additional insights or experiences that come up in the future.

Performance-wise, I have no complaints. For the first month, I felt the speakers were quite low in volume, even worse than my 6 year old HP office laptop. However, I eventually found out that this was a software issue with ASUS. The settings in the Dolby Access app was set to Music, which ironically made the quality of sound worse. I set it to Dynamic mode and the results are a complete game-changer(although still not super loud, it is way more satisfactory than before and the quality is actually very very good for a laptop speaker). The display and battery might be the old drawbacks of this laptop. The display is not bad at all but I felt 1440p has become the standard these days and only 250 NITS brightness can be quite low if you are seated near direct sunlight. However this is not an issue if you are always in your room under normal lighting conditions. Coming to the battery, it drains fast but that is something to be expected from a gaming laptop. After all, no one games on battery anyway. The camera is something that can definitely be improved too but that is not a concern for me(moreover, there is no camera privacy cover).

I've used it in almost every way possible. Be it gaming, productivity, daily tasks, etc.This laptop handles big AAA titles very comfortably. And the 4050 doesn't disappoint one bit. Imo, in this price range, nothing beats this GPU. So anyone looking to buy this for pure gaming, blindly go for it. Easily the best laptop in the 70-75k price bracket, not only for now but for 2-3 years easily. (Note: The fans will remind you of Boeing 777's jet, thing's LOUD while in turbo mode. I played RDR2, and you'll need a headphone to listen to anything. This might be a con, but the fans do their jobs, the thermals are pretty good. Never crossed 80-85¬∞)I also ran my CAD softwares and they ran smooth as butter. The 13th gen CPU does the job in terms of productivity and the 16gb RAM complements it well. One thing, if you're looking to buy this for video/photo editing, you might need an external display because what this laptop offers in performance, it compromises on display. Not saying is bad, it is good. Pretty good compared to some brands in the same bracket, but the specs demand a better display(like this laptop can run some games/softwares in 2k or even 4k, but the display cant provide that).The speakers are better than what I expected. They are way better than my previous ASUS TUF. So watching some OTT would be an enjoyable experience.Keyboard is nice, trackpad is big enough to work with and smooth while in use. The form factor is also a huge W. This laptop barely weighs 2 kg(maybe 2.1kg) but still less than the normal weight of a gaming laptop. Build quality is decent enough that i can sustain a few minor hits. Not on par with TUF but you ain't buying a Kevlar vest so it does the job.Battery is also okay. I mean 1.5-2 hr backup on efficiency mode is acceptable. Could be better but then again, can't ask everything in under 80k.To conclude, I would rate this Laptop asOverall 9.5/10Display 6.9/10Performance in productive tasks 10/10Performance in gaming 10/10Speakers 10/10Battery backup 7.5/10Build 8/10Anyone looking for a Laptop under 80k, with performance rivalling laptops in the 90-100k bracket, can surely buy this. Not gonna be disappointed.

I have done long gaming sessions on it and it doesn't heat a lot thanks to those fans that fire up when you start to game it keeps the chips cool.In short buy it if have the budget.

CPU will be a bottleneck in some cases as its a 13420H but will be fine for most used case scenarios.2) Battery is OK3) A little bit of false advertising saying it contains wifi 6E as shown in the attached photo but I checked and it has Wifi 6 Ax203. Most people won\'t notice the difference though.4) Display is just ok. Can\'t complain at this price as all other laptops in this price segment give similar displays. Colors are really unnatural but in Display settings->Advanced Display-> Turn on "Automatically manage colors for apps". It will be fine after that.5) Fans are loud yes but you can actually set custom speeds for fans easily, so I see no issue here. They are generally quiet when not gaming6) Tried Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra and I must say it was a delight7) No heating problems8) Looks are nice, I wanted something which looks simple and basic but packs a punch under its hood, perfect for me9) Lighter in weight than my previous laptop, no issues for me.In the end- If performance is your priority, while also looking decent for office or college, it can be a really good choice. I heard i7 variant will launch soon and if that comes under 90k, it will be quite insane.P.S- One thing I don\'t like is 512gb ssd only, If they had a option of 1tb at a little premium, it would be perfect.

Zephyrus models are insanely expensive in India. However, there\'s not much in the 14" gaming market and the only other competitor, Razer Blade is absurdly priced. G14 is the better poison. Out of box, the laptop\'s idle temp was around 48-52 deg. C. Ambient temp. was 28 deg. C (Bangalore, India) Estimated battery life was around 3-3.5 hours. Charge was around 80%. My Lenovo runs way cooler than this. But the battery life is around 2 hrs at 80%. No comparison with the Macbook Air M2. It runs a day and half on a single charge. Downloaded Wi-fi and chipset drivers from Asus website before performing a clean Windows 11 re-install. Wi-fi does not work on the new OS, until you install the downloaded wifi drivers Installed all the updates from Windows 11. Required multiple restarts. Installed MyAsus software Installed G-Helper Set the battery charge limit to 80% Enabled \'Efficient\' in CPU boost setting (Eco mode) Capped power limits to 20w and 40w (Eco mode) Capped CPU temp to 80 deg. (Eco mode) Have not touched the other settings yet Battery life: Silent + Eco mode, with the above mods, the estimate is around 8:30 - 9:15 hrs. Have used it unplugged for browsing, YouTube, spotify and WSL+VSCode work for over 6 hours. Battery was down to ~30% Heat Laptop idles at 38 deg. - 42 deg. C after the above steps The area around the lights (power/battery/hdd) get really hot during gaming. Other areas are fine. No issues. Lenovo Legion being a bigger chassis, runs cooler Macbook Air M2 runs ice cold. Sound Sound was very feeble post Windows 11 reinstall. Installed Dolby Access and set the profile to \'Dynamic\'. Sound is much better right now There is some sound vibration that you can feel near the keyboard area when songs / videos are playing and the volume is above 30-40%. Does not affect productivity. Sound does not work on Linux (Ubuntu). At least when I tried. The sound-stage is fairly wide The Lenovo and Macbook Air have a better sound. Specially the Mac. Can\'t compare as the difference is too much. Display My model has the nebula display at 165hz It\'s really crisp and I don\'t have any complaints I\'ve disabled AMD VariBright To me, this is a better display than my Legion Pro, but bested by the Mac. Power Supply Yes. You can charge it using a 100w usb c power supply I\'ve connected a Caldigit TS3 plus and it works perfectly In the 2023 models, I guess the laptop can draw power from the USB C directly. Please see the screenshot (BatteryMon) Network Wi-fi card is from MediaTek. However, speeds are reasonably good. I\'m sure an Intel card would perform better. Might upgrade later. The laptop detects the TS3 and the Ethernet port, however, internet does not work. Not sure if this is expected (since no thunderbolt) Performance The laptop performs. There\'s no other way to put it. It\'s everything as advertised and more. My model came with 16GB RAM. I\'m sure both the slots are used. Webcam + Mic They are an improvement over the older models but nothing to write about. Windows Hello works fine The Legion\'s webcam and mic are acceptable at best. The Mac is on another league.

However, my enthusiasm quickly turned to disappointment due to a persistent display issue and the lackluster customer service provided by HP.Within just 29 days of purchase, the laptop began exhibiting a frustrating problem where the display would inexplicably go blank and black upon startup. Despite my efforts to troubleshoot and seek assistance from HP's customer support, the issue persisted. Despite providing evidence of the problem through a recorded video, HP refused to offer a replacement, citing a restrictive policy that only allows replacements within the first 14 days of purchase.The fact that the issue mysteriously resolves itself after approximately one hour on both occasions only adds insult to injury. This not only raises concerns about the reliability and durability of the laptop but also highlights HP's lack of accountability and willingness to address customer concerns.In addition to the display problem, my overall experience with HP's customer service has been disappointing. Despite my willingness to cooperate and undergo further troubleshooting, HP's rigid stance on the replacement policy leaves much to be desired.Congratulations to Amazon and HP for successfully deceiving me too!

Although I don't play games, I can multitask, so I needed a laptop that would run quickly.I haven't bought a Business laptop because regular laptops don't have excellent build quality. The build quality of this laptop is excellent.Although the laptop is heavy, I don't find it problematic.An excellent perk is 8 GB of DDR5 RAM. A Samsung 512GB SSD M.2 2242 42mm PM9B1 NVMe PCIe 4.0 Gen4 was utilised by Dell. Thus, this laptop boots up quite quickly.It was simple to register the warranty, but keep in mind that Dell will only offer you a one-year basic guarantee.A 180W charger charges quickly. You can only use the battery saver option for up to 2.5 hours.Battery capacity is 56 Wh.The display on this laptop is very good. Pre-activated MSO 21 and Windows 11 is also a huge benefit.After comparing numerous laptops from Dell, HP, Asus, and Acer, I ultimately decided on Dell and think it was a wise decision.It is a supersilent device that doesn't become hot during normal use. The keyboard and mouse pad respond quickly and smoothly.The laptop's camera quality is the finest in the gaming market.Go for this laptop on faith. I paid ‚Çπ52,990 for it, so bide your time until the best offer comes along.Thank you, Amazon, for providing reliable service and superfast delivery within 1 day.Note: Since this is not an open box delivery, please preserve the video footage when you open the laptop box's seal.I'll modify this review if I run into any problems in future .

I'll highlight pointwise.Speed - The processor is 12 Gen i5 12500H with 45W and 12 cores. I code continuously and work on multiple tabs with high data and memory usage and the laptop handles everything smoothly. The screen refresh rate is a plus in this scenario as well in addition to gaming.Appearance - It has got looks to kill, everyone asks me which is this laptop. Looks superb.Build Quality - It is built to last and can take minor bumps easily.Display - The display quality is debatable for many but personally I like it a lot because it's easy on eyes and I can work whole day on it even in low light with very little to no eye strain. Oled and high res display are better but not for all day coders or gamers like me.Thermals - Many are saying it heats a lot. Yes it heats a lot only when you are gaming for high performance. If you don't turn on G button then it is like any other laptop and stays cool with better battery life as well.Sound - The laptop has sound quality like none other. You have to hear it to believe it. Trust ke you will feel like you are listening to tv or bluetooth speaker. It is that loud and smooth.Weight - The only downside is the weight. I recommend a good bag to carry the laptop as it is heavy. You will get used to it but it is heavy like other gaming laptops.Gameplay - Till now I played Forza 4&5,Battlefield, Fifa, GTA V and all ran smoothly with medium to high setting. Gaming is good but go for 16gb version if you solely want to play games. Else 8gb is enough for heavy work loads and casual gaming. Nvidia RTX3050 is so good, you'll know when you use it.Keyboard and Touchpad - The keys look great with orange back light and are very easy to click so is the touchpad super smooth.Outlets - It has got points for usb type all types, rj45, audio jack, hdmi so no issues.Camera - It is best in class and has good clarity.Finally Dell support and warranty is class leading, I got good warranty cover and support whenever needed with just a mail within their app provided in laptop.I wanted to go for dell latitude but G15 is better bang for buck so I opted for it.

The laptop works fine and offers value for money with its Intel Core i7-12700H 12th Gen processor and 8GB RTX 4060 graphics. However, it could benefit from a larger SSD and tends to heat up quickly during high-intensity games.Pros:Bright Display: Enhances gaming experience.Anti-Glare Screen: Reduces eye strain.Value for Money: High-end specs at a reasonable price.Cons:Limited Storage: Comes with 512GB SSD, 1TB or 2TB would have been better.Heating Issues: Tends to heat up quickly during high-intensity games. A cooling pad is recommended. Read more', 'cust_rating': '5.0'}, {'cust_name': 'meet', 'cust_review_desc': "The media could not be loaded. \xa0At this price, this is really a good deal for the performance this laptop has to offer.Boot time is around 30-35 seconds. Don't know why, but seems bit higher to me. Also the last BIOS time is around 10-12 seconds.BIOS settings has GUI (of course :D) for customizations like selecting the number of P & E cores to enable/disable. Unable to recall others atm.The CPU performance is as one would expect from 12700H. You're never out of performance with 14 cores (20, considering hyperthreading on P-cores). But get ready for higher level of fan noise for intensive tasks. Not that annoying but still. A laptop stand is recommended.What I like is Armoury crate has various options to tweak according to the needs for both CPU as well as GPU.Also, with My ASUS app there's an option for battery care which limits charging to 80% (cannot change this), which I personally like.Fans can indeed get little louder in performance mode itself. Happens when I play some games. With turbo mode, they're just as louder as they can get. The temperature reaches around 70-85 degrees even in older titles. For some reason, Armoury crate's power plan is being overridden by Windows when I play games.The display is okayish, not too good, but not that bad either. Good thing is 144Hz and G-Sync support. Take a note that max brightness is only 250 nits. So if you're planning to use it outdoors under a sunny day, it just might not be enough.Touchpad is great, scrolling is smooth, no lag whatsoever. Gets visible smudges though.WD's SN740 nvme is exceptional with 5000 MB/s and 4000 MB/s sequential read and write speeds respectively.Camera is quite awful. But, just enough for meetings and casual video calls I guess. Would recommend external ones though.Microphone is worst. External ones are highly recommended.Keyboard is decent enough. Number keys are bit squeezed. Feels little smaller than the ones I am used to in laptops. Customizable RGB lights (along with brightness, 0% to turn them off) with Armoury crate. Remember that only one color will be used for whole keyboard. Its not multi-zone. WASD keys are transparent.Speakers are decently loud. I use external ones so, can't say much about them, but from what I have heard until now, I would say it's not that bad, but would definitely prefer them little louder if I were to only use laptop's speakers. Its not a deal breaker though.For expansion, it supports upto 32 GB DDR4 RAM and 2TB SSD.It comes with bigger size plug (like the ones found in refrigerator, geysers, etc.), so a converter would be required to plug it into normal sockets. Makes sense, since the charger has to handle upto 240W of power. Input: 100-240V, 3.5A AC and Output: 20V, 10-12A DC.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase. It's been well over 15 days since I am using this laptop. Register the laptop on Asus' website once you receive it for warranty claims and other stuff.

But thanks to the cooling system, you can see the temperatures drop to normal temps which are around 40¬∞C to 48¬∞C. Keyoards feel amazing and touch and feel of the trackpad is also nice, i quite enjoyed it, but i use a wireless keyboard and a Redragon m810, so that's the best i can tell you base upon the three days i used the laaptop without any other accessories. Webcam is, good enough. I honestly have no use for it so i just stuck a privacy shutter on it. Ok, the lights, keyboard lights up, single zone rgb lighting and has Aura Sync, very useful for Diwali and other celebrations imo, and, customisable too. Gpu performs very well, good fps consistently and i actually do have to try it out more. Did a Blende Benchmark and got about 3178.14 or so score, which is, honestly good enough for anything a student of 3D animation like me could need, i mean we'll have to get a desktop towards the final year for portfolio projects anyway... And you get a 240W charger in the box. So, all in all, this is gotta be the best laptop for price to performance this year. If you have the budget, then go higher, but if you're like me who has a cap of about 1 Lakh and a little wiggle room up, then this is hands down the best thing available. And you can upgrade the ssd and ram later, and maybe replace the thermal paste with liquid metal, it'll definitely improve thermals.

So if you want to build now you can choose this one that is priced right. Other versions are overpriced and their prices will come down. Plus 4xxx series will take its own sweet time to stabilize and I have no interest in being the beta tester for products with exorbitant price and power requirements. One gripe though that my package had one side tape open. I thoroughly checked the card, it feels new, and apart from that didn't feel touched. So didn't decide to return it. I was able to register it on Zotac's site so it felt legit and searched on the internet this happens from time to time. It's not good practice by sellers so I am reducing 1 star.But I have no problems with the card itself and its running perfectly well and will suffice my needs so that I can upgrade to the 5xxx series when 5090Ti gets released ;)All of the games I play today are easily maxed out on 4K with 60fps easy-peasy.
